### What is the difference between `undefined` and `null` in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, `undefined` and `null` are both used to represent the absence or emptiness of a value, but they have different meanings and behaviors. Here are the main differences between `undefined` and `null`:

1. Meaning and assignment:
  - `undefined` is a primitive value that is automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value.
  - `null` is also a primitive value, but it is often assigned explicitly by a programmer to indicate the absence of an object or intentional absence of a value.

2. Type:
  - `undefined` is of type `undefined`. It represents an uninitialized or missing value.
  - `null` is of type `object`. It is considered an empty or non-existent object reference.

3. Behavior and usage:
  - When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is automatically assigned `undefined` by JavaScript. For example:
    ```javascript
    let x;
    console.log(x);  // Outputs: undefined
    ```

  - `undefined` is also the default return value of a function if no explicit return value is provided.

  - `null` is typically used when you want to explicitly indicate that a variable or object has no value or is intentionally empty. It is commonly used to reset or clear object references.

  - `null` is also used to check if a variable or object reference has been intentionally set to nothing. For example:
    ```javascript
    let obj = null;
    if (obj === null) {
      console.log("The object is null");
    }
    ```

4. Type conversion:
  - When `undefined` or `null` is compared to other values using loose equality (`==`), they exhibit different behaviors:
    - Comparing `undefined` with `null` using loose equality (`undefined == null`) returns `true`.
    - Comparing `undefined` or `null` with any other value using loose equality returns `false`, except for strict equality (`===`) comparisons with `null` and `undefined` themselves.

In summary, `undefined` is used by JavaScript to represent uninitialized or missing values, while `null` is a value that can be assigned to indicate the absence of an object or intentional absence of a value.
