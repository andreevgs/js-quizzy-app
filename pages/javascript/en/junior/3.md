### What is the purpose of the `typeof` operator in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, the `typeof` operator is used to determine the data type of a given value or expression. It returns a string that represents the data type of the operand. Here are some key aspects of the `typeof` operator:

1. Syntax:
   The syntax for the `typeof` operator is:
   ```javascript
   typeof operand
   ```

2. Return values:
   The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the data type of the operand. The possible return values are:
   - `"undefined"`: Represents an undefined value.
   - `"boolean"`: Represents a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
   - `"number"`: Represents a numeric value.
   - `"bigint"`: Represents a BigInt value.
   - `"string"`: Represents a string value.
   - `"symbol"`: Represents a symbol value.
   - `"object"`: Represents an object or `null`. Note that arrays, functions, and objects are all considered as `"object"` by `typeof`.
   - `"function"`: Represents a function.

3. Usage:
   The `typeof` operator can be used with variables, literals, or expressions. For example:
   ```javascript
   typeof x;             // Returns the data type of the variable x
   typeof 42;            // Returns "number"
   typeof "Hello";       // Returns "string"
   typeof true;          // Returns "boolean"
   typeof { key: "value" };   // Returns "object"
   typeof function() {}; // Returns "function"
   typeof undefined;     // Returns "undefined"
   ```

4. Limitations:
  - The `typeof` operator has some limitations and quirks. For example, it treats `null` as an object. So, `typeof null` returns `"object"`.
  - It does not distinguish between different types of objects (except functions) or between different built-in objects like arrays, dates, etc.
  - When used with arrays, `typeof` returns `"object"` instead of `"array"`. To check if a value is an array, you can use `Array.isArray()` or the `instanceof` operator.

The `typeof` operator is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the data type of a value dynamically or perform type-based operations or checks in your code. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations and use appropriate techniques for more precise type checks when needed.
