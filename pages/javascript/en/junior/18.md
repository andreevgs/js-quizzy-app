### What are the differences between a named function and an anonymous function in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, the differences between named functions and anonymous functions lie in their definitions and how they can be referenced or invoked.

Named Functions:
1. Definition: Named functions are functions that have a specified name in their function declaration or function expression syntax.
2. Function Name: Named functions have a specific identifier that can be used to reference or invoke the function.
3. Self-reference: Named functions can refer to themselves using their own function name.
4. Function Hoisting: Named function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, allowing them to be invoked before their actual declaration in the code.

Example of a Named Function:
```javascript
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}

console.log(square(5)); // Outputs: 25
```

Anonymous Functions:
1. Definition: Anonymous functions are functions that do not have a specified name. They are typically defined as function expressions.
2. Function Expression: Anonymous functions are assigned to a variable or used as an argument directly without a specific name.
3. Callback Functions: Anonymous functions are commonly used as callback functions, where they are passed as arguments to other functions.
4. Function Scoping: Anonymous functions can access variables from their surrounding scope, just like named functions.

Example of an Anonymous Function:
```javascript
const add = function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
};

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5
```

Key differences summary:
- Named functions have a specific identifier, while anonymous functions are not explicitly named.
- Named functions can refer to themselves using their function name, while anonymous functions cannot self-reference.
- Named function declarations are hoisted, while anonymous function expressions are not hoisted.
- Anonymous functions are commonly used as callback functions or assigned to variables.

Both named and anonymous functions have their use cases depending on the specific requirements of your code. Named functions are often preferred for better self-reference and stack traces in debugging, while anonymous functions are convenient for passing as arguments or creating one-time-use functions.
