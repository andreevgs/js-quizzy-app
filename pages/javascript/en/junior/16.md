### Describe the concept of lexical `this` in JavaScript and how it differs from dynamic `this`.

In JavaScript, the concept of "lexical this" refers to the behavior of the `this` keyword being determined by the surrounding lexical scope, rather than the runtime context. It ensures that the value of `this` is based on where a function is defined, rather than how or where it is called.

Here are the key points to understand about lexical this and its difference from dynamic this:

1. Lexical This:
  - In lexical this, the value of `this` is determined by the lexical scope, which is the scope in which a function is defined.
  - The value of `this` is set at the time of function definition and remains unchanged regardless of how or where the function is invoked.
  - Lexical this is often associated with arrow functions, which capture the `this` value from the surrounding scope.
  - Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context and do not bind the `this` value dynamically.

2. Dynamic This:
  - In dynamic this, the value of `this` is determined by the runtime context or the object on which a function is called.
  - The value of `this` can change based on how a function is invoked or called, regardless of where it is defined.
  - Dynamic this is commonly seen in regular functions when invoked as methods of an object, through explicit binding (using `call()` or `apply()`), or as constructors using the `new` keyword.

Example of Lexical This:

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
    }, 1000);
  }
};

obj.greet(); // Outputs: "Hello, John"
```

In this example, the arrow function inside the `setTimeout` captures the lexical scope of its surrounding function (`greet`). The `this` value within the arrow function refers to the `this` value of `greet`, which is the `obj` object. Therefore, it correctly accesses the `name` property of the `obj` object and logs "Hello, John" after the timeout.

Difference:
The main difference between lexical this and dynamic this is that lexical this preserves the `this` value from the surrounding scope, whereas dynamic this allows the `this` value to change based on the runtime context or function invocation.

Lexical this, often associated with arrow functions, provides a more predictable behavior for accessing the `this` value, especially in scenarios where you need to maintain the context of an outer function or avoid potential `this` binding issues.

Example of Dynamic This:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
};

const john = new Person('John');
const jane = new Person('Jane');

john.greet(); // Outputs: "Hello, John"
jane.greet(); // Outputs: "Hello, Jane"
```

In this example, the `Person` function acts as a constructor for creating `Person` objects. The `this` keyword is used to refer to the newly created object within the constructor, and the `name` property is assigned to each object.

The `greet` method is added to the prototype of the `Person` constructor, allowing all `Person` objects to have access to it. When `greet` is called on the `john` and `jane` objects, the value of `this` inside the `greet` method dynamically refers to the object on which the method is called. This allows each object to access its own `name` property and produce the appropriate greeting.

The value of `this` is determined at runtime based on how the function is called or the context in which it is invoked, allowing for dynamic binding of the `this` value.
