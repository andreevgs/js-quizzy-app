### Describe the purpose and usage of the `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()` methods in JavaScript.

The `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()` methods are part of the `Object` built-in object in JavaScript, introduced in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8). These methods provide easy ways to extract information from objects, including keys, values, and key-value pairs (entries). Let's explore the purpose and usage of each method:

1. **`Object.keys()` Method:**
  - Purpose: The `Object.keys()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names (keys). It extracts and returns only the keys that belong directly to the object, excluding inherited properties from the prototype chain.

  - Usage:
    ```javascript
    const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' };
    const keys = Object.keys(person);
    console.log(keys); // Output: ['name', 'age', 'city']
    ```

2. **`Object.values()` Method:**
  - Purpose: The `Object.values()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values. It extracts and returns only the values associated with the object's own properties, excluding inherited values from the prototype chain.

  - Usage:
    ```javascript
    const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' };
    const values = Object.values(person);
    console.log(values); // Output: ['John', 30, 'New York']
    ```

3. **`Object.entries()` Method:**
  - Purpose: The `Object.entries()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property `[key, value]` pairs. It extracts and returns both the keys and values associated with the object's own properties, excluding inherited properties from the prototype chain.

  - Usage:
    ```javascript
    const person = { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' };
    const entries = Object.entries(person);
    console.log(entries);
    // Output: [['name', 'John'], ['age', 30], ['city', 'New York']]
    ```

**Note:**
- All three methods consider only enumerable properties of an object.
- The order of the keys, values, and entries returned by these methods is determined by the order in which the properties were added to the object (except for integer keys, which are sorted).

**Polyfill for Older Browsers:**
If you need to use these methods in older browsers that don't support ES8, you can find polyfill implementations to add these functionalities to your codebase.

**Summary:**
The `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()` methods in JavaScript are powerful tools for extracting information from objects. They allow you to obtain the keys, values, and key-value pairs from objects in a simple and straightforward manner, making it easier to work with objects in various scenarios, such as iterating over their properties, performing transformations, or converting objects to arrays.
