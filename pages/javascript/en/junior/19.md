### What are the differences between a named function expression and an anonymous function expression in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, named function expressions and anonymous function expressions are two types of function expressions with key differences. Here are the distinctions between them:

Named Function Expression (NFE):
1. Definition: A named function expression is a function expression where the function has a specified name.
2. Function Name Usage: The name of the function can be used to refer to itself from within the function body or within its enclosing scope.
3. Function Scope: The name of the function is scoped only to the function expression itself and is not accessible from the outside.
4. Function Expression Hoisting: In some cases, the function expression's name can be hoisted within its scope, allowing it to be referenced before the actual function expression in the code.

Example of a Named Function Expression:
```javascript
const multiply = function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
};

console.log(multiply(2, 3)); // Outputs: 6
```

Anonymous Function Expression (AFE):
1. Definition: An anonymous function expression is a function expression without a specified name.
2. Function Name Usage: Anonymous function expressions cannot refer to themselves from within the function body or within their enclosing scope.
3. Function Scope: Since the function is anonymous, it cannot be accessed or referenced by name from the outside. It is typically assigned to a variable or used directly as an argument.
4. Function Expression Hoisting: Anonymous function expressions are not hoisted. They must be defined before they are used in the code.

Example of an Anonymous Function Expression:
```javascript
const add = function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
};

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5
```

Key differences summary:
- Named function expressions have a specified name, while anonymous function expressions do not have a name.
- Named function expressions can refer to themselves using their own name, while anonymous function expressions cannot self-reference.
- Named function expressions' names are scoped only to the function expression itself, while anonymous function expressions' names are not accessible.
- Named function expressions' names can be hoisted within their scope, while anonymous function expressions are not hoisted.

Both named function expressions and anonymous function expressions have their use cases depending on specific requirements and coding practices. Named function expressions are often preferred for better self-reference and stack traces in debugging, while anonymous function expressions are convenient for one-time-use or shorter-lived functions.
