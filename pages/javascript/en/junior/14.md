### Describe the concept of lexical scoping and closure in JavaScript. Provide an example to demonstrate their relationship.

Lexical scoping and closures are closely related concepts in JavaScript. Here's an explanation of each concept and an example to demonstrate their relationship:

1. Lexical Scoping:
  - Lexical scoping, also known as static scoping, determines how variable names are resolved in nested functions based on their lexical structure in the source code.
  - In lexical scoping, the scope of a variable is determined by its location in the source code during the authoring phase, not the execution phase.
  - Each function has access to variables defined in its own scope and the scopes of its parent functions, following the hierarchical structure defined by their nesting.

2. Closures:
  - A closure is created when an inner function is defined within the scope of an outer function and retains access to variables from the outer function's scope even after the outer function has finished executing.
  - A closure "closes over" or captures the variables it references, preserving them in its scope, allowing them to be accessed and used even when the outer function is no longer executing.
  - Closures are created automatically whenever a function is defined within another function.

Example:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  var outerVariable = "Hello";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

var closure = outerFunction();
closure(); // Outputs: "Hello"
```

In the example, `outerFunction` defines an `innerFunction` within its scope. The `innerFunction` references the `outerVariable` defined in its outer scope (`outerFunction`). When `outerFunction` is invoked and returns `innerFunction`, a closure is created. The closure encapsulates the `innerFunction` and the reference to `outerVariable`, preserving the variable even after `outerFunction` finishes executing.

When `closure` is invoked as `closure()`, it still has access to the `outerVariable` via the closure. The value of `outerVariable` is logged to the console, demonstrating how closures allow inner functions to access variables from their lexical scope, even when invoked outside their original scope.

In this example, the combination of lexical scoping and closures allows the `innerFunction` to "remember" and access the variable `outerVariable` from its parent scope, creating a powerful and flexible programming capability in JavaScript.
