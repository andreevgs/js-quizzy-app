### How to compare objects in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, comparing objects can be a bit tricky because objects are reference types. When you compare two objects using equality operators like `==` or `===`, they will only be equal if they refer to the same memory location, meaning they are the same exact object. This behavior is known as "reference equality."

For example:
```javascript
const obj1 = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
const obj2 = { name: 'John', age: 30 };

console.log(obj1 === obj2); // Output: false (they are different objects)
```

To compare the contents of two objects and determine if they have the same properties and values, you need to perform a "deep comparison" or "shallow comparison" based on your requirements.

**1. Shallow Comparison:**
A shallow comparison checks if the properties of two objects are the same, but it doesn't compare nested objects or arrays. One way to perform a shallow comparison is using the `Object.keys()` method to get the property names of each object and compare them.

```javascript
function shallowEqual(obj1, obj2) {
  const keys1 = Object.keys(obj1);
  const keys2 = Object.keys(obj2);

  if (keys1.length !== keys2.length) {
    return false;
  }

  for (const key of keys1) {
    if (obj1[key] !== obj2[key]) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}

const obj1 = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
const obj2 = { name: 'John', age: 30 };

console.log(shallowEqual(obj1, obj2)); // Output: true
```

**2. Deep Comparison:**
A deep comparison checks if the properties of two objects are the same, and it also compares nested objects and arrays recursively. To perform a deep comparison, you can use libraries like Lodash's `isEqual()` method or implement a custom deep comparison function.

Using Lodash:
```javascript
const _ = require('lodash');

const obj1 = { name: 'John', age: 30, address: { city: 'New York', country: 'USA' } };
const obj2 = { name: 'John', age: 30, address: { city: 'New York', country: 'USA' } };

console.log(_.isEqual(obj1, obj2)); // Output: true
```

**Note:** Be cautious when comparing objects with circular references, as deep comparison can result in infinite loops. Also, objects containing functions or special objects like Date or RegExp require special handling during deep comparison.

In summary, to compare objects in JavaScript, you can perform a shallow comparison to check if their properties are equal or use a deep comparison to compare their contents, including nested objects and arrays. The choice of comparison depends on the level of depth you need to compare and whether you want to use a library like Lodash for reliable and comprehensive comparison.
