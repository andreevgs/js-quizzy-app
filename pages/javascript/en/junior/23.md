### Explain the concept of currying in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, currying is a functional programming technique where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions that each take a single argument. The curried function returns another function that expects the next argument, and so on until all the original function's arguments are provided. The final function in the chain then produces the desired result.

Here are the key points to understand about currying in JavaScript:

1. Function Transformation:
  - Currying converts a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of unary (single-argument) functions.
  - Each intermediate function in the curried chain takes one argument and returns another function, except for the last function, which produces the final result.

2. Partial Application:
  - Currying allows partial application of arguments to a function.
  - When currying a function, you can pass a subset of the arguments, which will return a new function that expects the remaining arguments.

3. Reusability and Composition:
  - Curried functions are more reusable as they can be partially applied or composed with other functions more easily.
  - By breaking down a function into smaller unary functions, currying enables more flexible function composition.

Example of Currying in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Regular function with multiple arguments
function add(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

// Curried version of the same function
function curriedAdd(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return function(z) {
      return x + y + z;
    };
  };
}

// Usage of curriedAdd
const result = curriedAdd(2)(3)(4); // Output: 9
```

In this example, we have the regular `add` function that takes three arguments (`x`, `y`, and `z`) and returns their sum. The `curriedAdd` function is the curried version of `add`, where each argument is transformed into a series of functions that return another function until all arguments are provided.

The curried version of the function allows partial application and more flexible function composition. For example, you can use `curriedAdd(2)` to obtain a new function that expects `y` and `z` as arguments, and then further use `curriedAdd(2)(3)` to get a function that only requires `z`. Finally, `curriedAdd(2)(3)(4)` provides the result of `9`.

Currying is a powerful technique for creating more flexible and composable functions in JavaScript, and it is widely used in functional programming paradigms. Libraries like Ramda and lodash/fp also provide utility functions for currying and functional composition.
