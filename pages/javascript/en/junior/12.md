### What is lexical scoping in JavaScript?

Lexical scoping, also known as static scoping, is a concept in JavaScript (and many other programming languages) that determines how variable names are resolved in nested functions based on their lexical (or static) structure in the source code. It defines the accessibility and visibility of variables at the time of function definition, rather than at the time of function execution.

Here are key points to understand about lexical scoping in JavaScript:

1. Scope Hierarchy:
  - Lexical scoping establishes a hierarchical relationship between functions based on their nesting in the source code.
  - Each function has access to variables defined in its own scope and the scopes of its parent functions, all the way up to the global scope.

2. Lexical Scope Resolution:
  - When a variable is referenced within a function, JavaScript looks for that variable in the current scope first.
  - If the variable is not found, it continues to search in the next outer scope, following the lexical structure until it finds the variable or reaches the global scope.
  - This process is called lexical scope resolution or variable lookup.

3. Outer (Enclosing) Scope:
  - In lexical scoping, the scope in which a function is defined is known as its outer scope or enclosing scope.
  - Variables defined in the outer scope are accessible within the function and its nested functions.
  - However, variables defined within a function are not accessible in its parent or sibling functions.

4. Example:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  var outerVariable = "Hello";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction(); // Outputs: "Hello"
```

In the example, the `innerFunction` has access to the `outerVariable` defined in its outer scope (`outerFunction`), according to lexical scoping rules. When `innerFunction` is invoked, it logs the value of `outerVariable` to the console.

Lexical scoping provides a predictable and understandable way to determine variable visibility and access in nested functions. It facilitates encapsulation, data privacy, and modular programming by controlling the visibility of variables within their intended scopes.
