### Describe the purpose and usage of the `Array.prototype.find()` and `Array.prototype.findIndex()` methods in JavaScript.

The `Array.prototype.find()` and `Array.prototype.findIndex()` are two array methods in JavaScript used to search for elements in an array based on a specified condition. They are designed to return information about the first element that satisfies the condition.

1. `Array.prototype.find()`:
  - Purpose: The `find()` method is used to retrieve the value of the first element in the array that matches a given condition. It returns the value of the first element for which the provided callback function returns `true`. If no such element is found, it returns `undefined`.

  - Usage: The method takes a callback function as an argument, which is executed for each element in the array. The first element that returns `true` from the callback is returned by the `find()` method.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

   const foundNumber = numbers.find((num) => num > 25);
   console.log(foundNumber); // Output: 30 (the first element greater than 25)
   ```

2. `Array.prototype.findIndex()`:
  - Purpose: The `findIndex()` method is similar to `find()`, but it returns the index of the first element that satisfies the condition instead of the element itself. If no element is found, it returns -1.

  - Usage: Like `find()`, `findIndex()` takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function is executed for each element in the array, and the index of the first element that returns `true` from the callback is returned.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

   const foundIndex = numbers.findIndex((num) => num > 25);
   console.log(foundIndex); // Output: 2 (the index of the first element greater than 25)
   ```

Both methods are valuable for searching and filtering arrays based on specific criteria. They provide a concise way to locate elements or their indices, helping to simplify array manipulation tasks.

In summary:
- `Array.prototype.find()` returns the value of the first element that satisfies the condition.
- `Array.prototype.findIndex()` returns the index of the first element that satisfies the condition.

These methods are commonly used in scenarios where you need to find a specific element in an array or determine its index. They are particularly helpful when dealing with large arrays and the need to efficiently search for specific elements.
