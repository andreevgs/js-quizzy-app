### Explain the concept of object destructuring in JavaScript and provide an example of its usage.

Object destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables. It provides a concise and elegant way to access and use specific properties of an object without explicitly accessing them through dot notation or bracket notation. Destructuring can improve code readability, especially when working with complex objects that have many properties.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
const { property1, property2, ... } = object;
```

- `property1`, `property2`, etc.: The names of the variables to which the corresponding properties of the object will be assigned.
- `object`: The source object from which the properties are being extracted.

**Usage:**
```javascript
// Example object
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  gender: 'male',
  occupation: 'developer'
};

// Object destructuring
const { name, age } = person;

console.log(name); // Output: 'John Doe'
console.log(age);  // Output: 30
```

In this example, the object `person` contains properties such as `name`, `age`, `gender`, and `occupation`. With object destructuring, we can extract and create variables for only the properties we need. In this case, we extracted the `name` and `age` properties from the `person` object and bound them to `name` and `age` variables.

We can also provide default values in case the property is not present in the object:

```javascript
const { name, age, city = 'Unknown' } = person;

console.log(city); // Output: 'Unknown' (since the 'city' property doesn't exist in the 'person' object)
```

Object destructuring can be especially useful when working with function parameters:

```javascript
function printPersonInfo({ name, age }) {
  console.log(`Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}`);
}

printPersonInfo(person); // Output: 'Name: John Doe, Age: 30'
```

This allows us to extract specific properties directly from the object passed as an argument to the function without having to access them individually within the function body.

In summary, object destructuring provides a convenient way to extract and assign object properties to variables, leading to more concise and readable code when working with objects in JavaScript.
