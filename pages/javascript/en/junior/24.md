### Describe the concept of memoization in JavaScript and how it can be implemented.

Memoization is an optimization technique used in computer programming to cache the results of expensive function calls and avoid unnecessary re-computation. In JavaScript, memoization is often applied to functions that are computationally intensive or have repeated calculations with the same input.

The basic idea of memoization is to store the result of a function call in a cache object or data structure the first time it is called with a particular set of arguments. Subsequent calls to the same function with the same arguments can then be returned directly from the cache, avoiding the need to recompute the result.

Here are the key points to understand about memoization in JavaScript:

1. Caching Results:
  - Memoization involves storing the computed results of function calls in a cache object.
  - The cache can be implemented using a simple JavaScript object or a Map, where the function arguments act as keys, and the corresponding results act as values.

2. Expensive Functions:
  - Memoization is especially useful for functions that are computationally expensive or have a high time complexity.
  - By caching results, the function can avoid redundant calculations and improve performance.

3. Pure Functions:
  - Memoization works best with pure functions that always produce the same output for the same input.
  - If a function has side effects or relies on external state, memoization might lead to incorrect results.

Implementation of Memoization:

Here's a simple implementation of memoization using a cache object:

```javascript
function memoize(func) {
  const cache = {};
  return function(...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (cache.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      console.log("Fetching from cache...");
      return cache[key];
    } else {
      console.log("Calculating result...");
      const result = func(...args);
      cache[key] = result;
      return result;
    }
  };
}

// Example function to be memoized
function expensiveFunction(a, b) {
  console.log("Executing expensiveFunction...");
  return a + b;
}

const memoizedExpensiveFunction = memoize(expensiveFunction);

console.log(memoizedExpensiveFunction(2, 3)); // Output: Executing expensiveFunction... Calculating result... 5
console.log(memoizedExpensiveFunction(2, 3)); // Output: Fetching from cache... 5 (No recalculation)
```

In this example, we have the `memoize` function, which takes a function `func` as input and returns a new function that is memoized. The memoized function is created by wrapping the original function with caching logic. The `cache` object stores the computed results, and the function arguments are used as keys to retrieve or store the results.

The first time `memoizedExpensiveFunction` is called with arguments `(2, 3)`, it calculates the result and caches it. The second time it is called with the same arguments, it fetches the result directly from the cache, avoiding recalculation.

Memoization is a powerful technique for optimizing function calls and can significantly improve the performance of functions with repetitive computations. However, it is essential to use memoization judiciously, as it might consume more memory when caching large amounts of data or impure functions with varying results for the same input.
