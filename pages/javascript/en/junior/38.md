### Describe the purpose and usage of the `Array.prototype.concat()` and `Array.prototype.join()` methods in JavaScript.

The `Array.prototype.concat()` and `Array.prototype.join()` are two useful array methods in JavaScript that facilitate array manipulation and string formatting.

1. `Array.prototype.concat()`:
  - Purpose: The `concat()` method is used to combine two or more arrays into a new array. It does not modify the original arrays; instead, it returns a new array containing the elements from all the arrays.

  - Usage: The method takes one or more arrays as arguments and combines them into a new array.

   ```javascript
   const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
   const array2 = [4, 5, 6];

   const combinedArray = array1.concat(array2);
   console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

   You can also use the `concat()` method to add elements directly to an existing array:

   ```javascript
   const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
   const additionalElements = [4, 5, 6];

   array1.concat(4, 5, 6); // Does not modify array1
   console.log(array1); // Output: [1, 2, 3]

   const newArray = array1.concat(additionalElements);
   console.log(newArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

2. `Array.prototype.join()`:
  - Purpose: The `join()` method is used to join all elements of an array into a single string. It converts each element into a string and concatenates them using a specified separator (default is a comma).

  - Usage: The method takes an optional separator string as an argument. If no separator is provided, it uses a comma as the default separator.

   ```javascript
   const fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana'];

   const joinedString = fruits.join(); // Default separator (comma)
   console.log(joinedString); // Output: "apple,orange,banana"

   const customSeparator = fruits.join(' | ');
   console.log(customSeparator); // Output: "apple | orange | banana"
   ```

   The `join()` method is useful when you want to create a formatted string representation of the elements in an array.

Both `concat()` and `join()` methods do not modify the original arrays; they create new arrays or strings as a result of their operations. They provide convenient ways to manipulate arrays and convert them into strings without changing the original data.
