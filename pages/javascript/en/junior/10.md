### Describe the concept of functional programming and provide an example of a pure function.

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data. It involves treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoiding changing state or mutable data.

The key principles of functional programming include:

1. Pure Functions:
  - Pure functions are functions that always produce the same output for the same input, and they don't cause any side effects.
  - Pure functions have no dependencies on the state of the program or external factors.
  - They only depend on their input arguments and return a new value without modifying the original data.
  - Pure functions are predictable, easier to reason about, and facilitate testing and code reuse.

2. Immutable Data:
  - In functional programming, data is treated as immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once created.
  - Instead of modifying data, new data structures are created with the desired changes.
  - This ensures data consistency and eliminates issues related to shared mutable state.

3. Function Composition:
  - Functional programming promotes composing functions by combining smaller functions to create more complex ones.
  - This allows for building modular and reusable code by chaining together functions in a declarative manner.

4. Higher-order Functions:
  - Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.
  - They enable encapsulating reusable behavior and implementing powerful abstractions.

An example of a pure function:

```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

The `multiply` function is a pure function because it always returns the same result for the same input arguments (`a` and `b`). It doesn't rely on any external state or modify any variables outside its scope. It solely operates on the input and produces a new value as output.

Calling `multiply(2, 3)` will always return `6`, regardless of the program's state or any external factors. It doesn't have any side effects, such as modifying variables, accessing the DOM, or making network requests.

Functional programming promotes the use of pure functions to build programs with clearer logic, improved maintainability, and better testability.
