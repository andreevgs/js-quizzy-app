### What is the difference between a shallow clone and a deep clone in JavaScript? When would you use each?

The difference between a shallow clone and a deep clone in JavaScript lies in how they handle nested objects and arrays when creating a copy of an original object. Let's define each concept and explore when to use each approach:

**1. Shallow Clone:**
A shallow clone creates a new object that is a copy of the original object, but it does not create copies of the nested objects or arrays within the original object. Instead, it maintains references to the nested objects. As a result, changes made to the nested objects in the cloned object will also affect the original object.

**Example of Shallow Clone:**
```javascript
const originalObj = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    country: 'USA'
  }
};

const shallowCloneObj = { ...originalObj };

console.log(shallowCloneObj === originalObj); // Output: false (different objects)
console.log(shallowCloneObj.address === originalObj.address); // Output: true (same nested object)
```

**Usage of Shallow Clone:**
Use shallow cloning when you want to create a quick and lightweight copy of an object and you don't need deep copying behavior. Shallow cloning is efficient and appropriate for simple objects without complex nested structures.

**2. Deep Clone:**
A deep clone creates a new object that is a copy of the original object, including copies of all nested objects and arrays within the original object. This means that the cloned object is completely independent of the original object, and changes made to the nested objects in the cloned object will not affect the original object.

**Example of Deep Clone:**
```javascript
const originalObj = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    country: 'USA'
  }
};

const deepCloneObj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObj));

console.log(deepCloneObj === originalObj); // Output: false (different objects)
console.log(deepCloneObj.address === originalObj.address); // Output: false (different nested objects)
```

**Usage of Deep Clone:**
Use deep cloning when you need a completely independent copy of the original object, including all nested objects and arrays. Deep cloning is appropriate when dealing with complex and nested data structures, and when you want to avoid unintended side effects on the original object due to changes made to the cloned object.

**Caution:**
Be aware that deep cloning using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` has limitations. It cannot handle circular references or preserve special objects like RegExp, Date, or functions. In such cases, you may need to use custom deep cloning libraries like Lodash's `_.cloneDeep()` or implement your own deep cloning function.

In summary, use shallow cloning when you need a quick and simple copy of an object without deep nesting, and use deep cloning when you want an independent copy that includes all nested objects and arrays, or when dealing with complex data structures. Carefully consider the implications of each approach to ensure your code behaves as expected.
