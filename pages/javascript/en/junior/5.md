### What are the differences between `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` are all used to represent different kinds of absence or invalid values. Here are the main differences between them:

1. `null`:
   - `null` is a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of an object value.
   - It is typically assigned explicitly by a programmer to indicate that a variable or object reference has no value or is intentionally empty.
   - When a variable is assigned `null`, it means that the variable points to no object.
   - For example:
     ```javascript
     let obj = null;
     ```

2. `undefined`:
   - `undefined` is a primitive value that represents an uninitialized or missing value.
   - It is automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value.
   - It is also the default return value of a function if no explicit return value is provided.
   - For example:
     ```javascript
     let x;
     console.log(x);  // Outputs: undefined
     ```

3. `NaN` (Not-a-Number):
   - `NaN` is a special value of the Number type in JavaScript that indicates an invalid or nonsensical result of a mathematical operation.
   - It is the result of operations that cannot produce a meaningful numeric value.
   - For example, dividing zero by zero or attempting to convert a non-numeric string to a number will result in `NaN`.
   - For example:
     ```javascript
     console.log(0 / 0);   // Outputs: NaN
     console.log(parseInt("Hello"));   // Outputs: NaN
     ```

4. Type:
   - `null` and `undefined` are primitive values of their own types.
   - `NaN` is a special value of the Number type.

5. Type conversion:
   - When comparing `null` and `undefined` using loose equality (`==`), they are considered equal.
   - Comparing `NaN` with any value, including `NaN` itself, using any equality operator (`==`, `===`, etc.), will always result in `false`.

In summary, `null` represents the intentional absence of an object value, `undefined` represents uninitialized or missing values, and `NaN` represents invalid or nonsensical numeric results.
