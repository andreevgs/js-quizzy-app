### What are the differences between `==` and `===` in JavaScript? When should you use each?

In JavaScript, `==` and `===` are used for equality comparisons, but they have different behaviors. Here are the main differences between them:

1. Loose equality (`==`):
  - The `==` operator performs type coercion, meaning it converts the operands to a common type before comparison.
  - If the operands have different types, JavaScript tries to convert one or both of them to a common type.
  - It allows "loose" equality, where values of different types can be considered equal based on their underlying values after conversion.
  - For example, `1 == '1'` evaluates to `true` because the string `'1'` is coerced to the number `1` before comparison.

2. Strict equality (`===`):
  - The `===` operator performs strict equality comparison without type coercion.
  - It compares the values as well as their types.
  - The operands must have the same type to be considered equal.
  - For example, `1 === '1'` evaluates to `false` because the number `1` and the string `'1'` have different types.

When to use each:
- Use `===` (strict equality) by default:
  - It ensures that both the values and the types are equal, which helps avoid unexpected behavior caused by type coercion.
  - It is generally considered safer and leads to more reliable code.
- Use `==` (loose equality) only when you explicitly need type coercion:
  - There may be cases where you want to allow comparisons between values of different types, and you expect JavaScript's type coercion rules to handle it appropriately.
  - However, be cautious when using loose equality, as it can lead to subtle bugs if you're not familiar with JavaScript's type coercion rules.

It is generally recommended to use strict equality (`===`) unless you have a specific reason to use loose equality (`==`) and fully understand its implications.

Note: The `!=` and `!==` operators are the inequality counterparts of `==` and `===`, respectively, and follow the same principles.
