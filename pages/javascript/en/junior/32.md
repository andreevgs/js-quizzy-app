### Describe the purpose and usage of the `Array.from()` and `Array.of()` methods in JavaScript.

`Array.from()` and `Array.of()` are two methods available in JavaScript's `Array` object that provide different functionalities for working with arrays.

1. `Array.from()`:
  - Purpose: The `Array.from()` method is used to create a new array from an array-like or iterable object. It converts array-like objects (such as strings, sets, maps, and node lists) or iterable objects (such as generators or the arguments object) into proper arrays.

  - Usage: The method takes three optional arguments:

    - `arrayLike` (Required): The array-like or iterable object to be converted into an array.
    - `mapFn` (Optional): A mapping function that can be used to modify the elements of the new array before they are added. It works similarly to the `Array.prototype.map()` method.
    - `thisArg` (Optional): An optional `this` argument that is used as the `this` value inside the `mapFn`.

   ```javascript
   // Converting a string to an array of characters
   const str = 'hello';
   const arr = Array.from(str); // ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

   // Converting a set to an array
   const set = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
   const arrFromSet = Array.from(set); // [1, 2, 3]
   ```

2. `Array.of()`:
  - Purpose: The `Array.of()` method is used to create a new array from the arguments passed to the method. It ensures that all the arguments are treated as individual elements of the new array.

  - Usage: The method takes any number of arguments, and each argument becomes an element of the new array.

   ```javascript
   const arr = Array.of(1, 2, 3); // [1, 2, 3]
   ```

   Unlike the regular array literal syntax `[ ]`, `Array.of()` avoids creating sparse arrays when passed a single numeric argument.

   ```javascript
   const sparseArray = new Array(5); // Creates a sparse array with a length of 5 but no elements
   const regularArray = Array.of(5); // Creates an array with one element: [5]
   ```

Both methods are useful for creating arrays in different scenarios. `Array.from()` is suitable for converting iterable or array-like objects into proper arrays, whereas `Array.of()` is useful for creating arrays with specific elements, ensuring that each argument is treated as an individual array element.

It's worth noting that `Array.from()` can be used as a more flexible alternative to the array constructor `Array()` when you want to create arrays dynamically or from non-array-like objects. On the other hand, `Array.of()` is particularly helpful in scenarios where you need to create an array with known elements directly from the method's arguments.
