### What is the purpose of the `Object.assign()` method in JavaScript? Provide an example of its usage.

The `Object.assign()` method in JavaScript is used to copy the values of all enumerable properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It is primarily used to merge objects or make shallow copies of objects.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
Object.assign(target, ...sources);
```

- `target`: The target object to which the properties will be copied.
- `...sources`: One or more source objects from which the properties will be copied to the target object.

**Usage:**
```javascript
const target = {};
const source1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source2 = { b: 3, c: 4 };

Object.assign(target, source1, source2);

console.log(target); // Output: { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
```

In this example, we have an empty `target` object, and two source objects `source1` and `source2`. When we use `Object.assign()` to merge `source1` and `source2` into `target`, the properties from both source objects are copied to the `target` object.

**Note:**
- If a property with the same name exists in multiple source objects, the last source object's value will overwrite the earlier ones in the target object.
- The method only performs a shallow copy, meaning that nested objects or arrays will be copied by reference and not deep cloned.

**Cloning Objects with `Object.assign()`:**
`Object.assign()` can also be used to create a shallow clone of an object by copying its properties to a new empty object.

```javascript
const original = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const clone = Object.assign({}, original);

console.log(clone); // Output: { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } }
console.log(clone === original); // Output: false (different objects)
console.log(clone.b === original.b); // Output: true (shallow copy of nested object)
```

In this example, we create a shallow clone of the `original` object by passing an empty object `{}` as the target of `Object.assign()`. The properties of `original` are copied to the new object `clone`. While the `clone` object is a new independent object, its nested object `b` is still a reference to the same object as in the `original`, as `Object.assign()` performs a shallow copy.

**Object.assign() with Inherited Properties:**
`Object.assign()` only copies enumerable own properties of the source objects. It does not copy properties from the prototype chain.

```javascript
const parent = { a: 1 };
const child = Object.create(parent);
child.b = 2;

const merged = Object.assign({}, child);

console.log(merged); // Output: { b: 2 }
```

In this example, `child` inherits the property `a` from its prototype `parent`, but `Object.assign()` only copies the own property `b` to the `merged` object.

**Note:** As of ECMAScript 2018 (ES9), the `Object.assign()` method will preserve the order of the properties, just like for...in loops. However, this behavior is not guaranteed in earlier versions of JavaScript.

In summary, `Object.assign()` is a useful method for merging objects or creating shallow clones. It copies enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. When used correctly, it can simplify object manipulation and data handling in JavaScript applications.

These resources provide detailed explanations, examples, and further insights into the purpose, usage, and behavior of the `Object.assign()` method in JavaScript. They cover how to use `Object.assign()` to merge objects, create shallow clones, and copy properties to target objects. The resources also highlight the limitations of `Object.assign()` when dealing with inherited properties and nested objects.
