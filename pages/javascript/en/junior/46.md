### Explain the concept of strict equality (`Object.is()`) in JavaScript and how it differs from `===`.

In JavaScript, strict equality is a comparison method that checks whether two values are exactly equal without any type coercion. The strict equality operator `===` is commonly used for this purpose. It returns `true` if both the values and their types are the same, and `false` otherwise.

For example:
```javascript
console.log(5 === 5);          // Output: true (both values and types are the same)
console.log(5 === '5');        // Output: false (types are different)
console.log(5 === 6);          // Output: false (values are different)
console.log('hello' === 'hello');  // Output: true (both values and types are the same)
```

On the other hand, `Object.is()` is a method introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that provides a more precise way to perform strict equality comparison. It differs from `===` in three specific cases:

1. **NaN comparison:**
   In JavaScript, `NaN` is considered not equal to itself when using the strict equality operator `===`. However, `Object.is()` returns `true` when comparing two `NaN` values.

   ```javascript
   console.log(NaN === NaN);       // Output: false
   console.log(Object.is(NaN, NaN)); // Output: true
   ```

2. **Positive and negative zero comparison:**
   JavaScript has both positive zero (`+0`) and negative zero (`-0`). The strict equality operator treats them as equal, but `Object.is()` differentiates between them.

   ```javascript
   console.log(0 === -0);            // Output: true
   console.log(Object.is(0, -0));    // Output: false
   ```

3. **Non-primitive types comparison:**
   When comparing non-primitive values (objects, arrays, functions, etc.), `===` and `Object.is()` behave the same, as they both check for reference equality in this case.

   ```javascript
   const obj1 = { a: 1 };
   const obj2 = { a: 1 };
   
   console.log(obj1 === obj2);          // Output: false (different objects, reference equality)
   console.log(Object.is(obj1, obj2));  // Output: false (different objects, reference equality)
   ```

**Summary:**
In most cases, `===` and `Object.is()` behave identically, and you can use them interchangeably for strict equality comparisons. However, `Object.is()` provides more accuracy in three specific scenarios: comparing `NaN`, differentiating between positive and negative zero, and avoiding reference equality when comparing non-primitive values.

It's essential to understand the behavior of both strict equality operators and choose the appropriate one based on your specific comparison needs.
