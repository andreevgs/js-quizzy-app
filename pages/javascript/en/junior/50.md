### Describe the purpose and usage of the `Object.freeze()`, `Object.seal()`, and `Object.preventExtensions()` methods in JavaScript.

The `Object.freeze()`, `Object.seal()`, and `Object.preventExtensions()` methods are used to control the mutability of objects in JavaScript. They allow you to impose certain restrictions on an object to prevent changes to its properties and structure. Let's explore the purpose and usage of each method:

1. **`Object.freeze()` Method:**
   - Purpose: The `Object.freeze()` method is used to freeze an object, making it immutable. Once an object is frozen, its properties cannot be added, deleted, or modified. Any attempt to modify the object will be ignored or result in an error (in strict mode).
   - Usage:
     ```javascript
     const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };

     Object.freeze(obj);

     obj.c = 3; // Ignored in non-strict mode, throws an error in strict mode
     delete obj.a; // Ignored in non-strict mode, throws an error in strict mode

     console.log(obj); // Output: { a: 1, b: 2 }
     ```
   - Note:
     - `Object.freeze()` only operates at the top level of the object. It does not make nested objects or arrays immutable.

2. **`Object.seal()` Method:**
   - Purpose: The `Object.seal()` method seals an object, preventing new properties from being added and marking existing properties as non-configurable. However, the values of existing properties can still be modified.
   - Usage:
     ```javascript
     const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };

     Object.seal(obj);

     obj.c = 3; // Ignored, property cannot be added
     obj.a = 42; // Value of 'a' can be modified

     delete obj.b; // Ignored, property cannot be deleted

     console.log(obj); // Output: { a: 42, b: 2 }
     ```
   - Note:
     - While you cannot add or delete properties, you can modify the values of existing properties after sealing the object.

3. **`Object.preventExtensions()` Method:**
   - Purpose: The `Object.preventExtensions()` method prevents new properties from being added to an object, but it allows the modification and deletion of existing properties.
   - Usage:
     ```javascript
     const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };

     Object.preventExtensions(obj);

     obj.c = 3; // Ignored, property cannot be added
     obj.a = 42; // Value of 'a' can be modified

     delete obj.b; // Property can be deleted

     console.log(obj); // Output: { a: 42 }
     ```
   - Note:
     - While you cannot add new properties, you can modify and delete existing properties after preventing extensions.

**Summary:**
- `Object.freeze()`: Makes an object immutable, preventing addition, deletion, and modification of properties.
- `Object.seal()`: Seals an object, preventing the addition of new properties, but allows modification of existing properties.
- `Object.preventExtensions()`: Prevents the addition of new properties, but allows modification and deletion of existing properties.

It's important to use these methods carefully, as they impose immutability and restrictions on objects, which can affect the behavior of your JavaScript application. Choose the method that best fits your specific use case and mutability requirements.
