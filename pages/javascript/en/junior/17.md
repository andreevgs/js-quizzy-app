### Explain the concept of function composition in JavaScript and provide an example.

Function composition in JavaScript refers to the practice of combining multiple functions to create a new function that performs a sequence of operations. It involves taking the output of one function and using it as the input for another function, forming a chain of functions that work together to solve a problem or transform data.

Here are the key points to understand about function composition:

1. Composable Functions:
  - In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens and can be passed around as values.
  - Composable functions are functions that can be easily combined or chained together to create new functions.

2. Input and Output:
  - Function composition relies on the input and output relationships between functions.
  - The output of one function becomes the input for the next function in the composition chain.
  - Each function in the composition takes the output of the previous function and transforms it further.

3. Pure Functions:
  - Function composition is most effective when working with pure functions.
  - Pure functions produce the same output for the same input and do not have side effects, making them reliable and predictable for composition.

Example of Function Composition:

```javascript
function addOne(x) {
  return x + 1;
}

function double(x) {
  return x * 2;
}

function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}

const composedFunction = (x) => square(double(addOne(x)));

console.log(composedFunction(5)); // Outputs: 196
```

In this example, we have three functions: `addOne`, `double`, and `square`. We want to create a new function that adds one to a number, doubles it, and then squares the result.

The `composedFunction` uses function composition to combine `addOne`, `double`, and `square` in a chain. It takes an input `x`, passes it through the functions in the specified order, and returns the final result.

Calling `composedFunction(5)` will perform the following steps:
1. `addOne(5)` returns `6`.
2. `double(6)` returns `12`.
3. `square(12)` returns `144`.

Therefore, the final output is `144`.

Function composition allows us to create reusable and modular code by combining smaller functions to perform complex operations. It promotes code readability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.
