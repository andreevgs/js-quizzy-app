### What are the differences between `hasOwnProperty()` and `in` operator in JavaScript?

Both `hasOwnProperty()` and the `in` operator in JavaScript are used to check for the existence of properties in an object, but they have some differences in behavior:

1. **`hasOwnProperty()` method:**
  - Purpose: `hasOwnProperty()` is a method available on all objects in JavaScript. It checks if an object has a property with the specified name and returns `true` if the property exists directly on the object (not inherited from its prototype).

  - Usage:
    ```javascript
    const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };

    console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('a')); // Output: true
    console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('toString')); // Output: false (toString is inherited from Object.prototype)
    ```

  - Differences:
    - `hasOwnProperty()` specifically checks for own properties of an object, i.e., properties that are directly defined on the object itself, not properties inherited from its prototype chain.

2. **`in` operator:**
  - Purpose: The `in` operator checks if a property exists in an object, including properties that may be inherited from the object's prototype chain.

  - Usage:
    ```javascript
    const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };

    console.log('a' in obj); // Output: true
    console.log('toString' in obj); // Output: true (toString is inherited from Object.prototype)
    ```

  - Differences:
    - The `in` operator checks for both own properties of the object and properties inherited from its prototype chain.
    - It is not restricted to own properties like `hasOwnProperty()` and can traverse the entire prototype chain to find a property.

**Summary:**
The main differences between `hasOwnProperty()` and the `in` operator are:

- `hasOwnProperty()` checks for own properties of an object and ignores properties inherited from its prototype chain.
- The `in` operator checks for both own properties and properties inherited from the prototype chain.

So, if you want to check only for own properties of an object, use `hasOwnProperty()`. If you need to check for a property's existence regardless of whether it is an own property or inherited from prototypes, use the `in` operator.
