### Describe the purpose and usage of the `Array.prototype.some()` and `Array.prototype.every()` methods in JavaScript.

The `Array.prototype.some()` and `Array.prototype.every()` are two array methods in JavaScript that are used to check the elements of an array based on certain conditions. They return a Boolean value indicating whether the elements satisfy the specified condition or not.

1. `Array.prototype.some()`:
  - Purpose: The `some()` method is used to check if at least one element in the array satisfies a given condition. It returns `true` if any element passes the condition; otherwise, it returns `false`.

  - Usage: The method takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function is executed for each element in the array until it returns `true` for at least one element, at which point the `some()` method stops iterating and returns `true`. If no element satisfies the condition, it returns `false`.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

   const hasEvenNumber = numbers.some((num) => num % 2 === 0);
   console.log(hasEvenNumber); // Output: true (at least one element is even)
   ```

2. `Array.prototype.every()`:
  - Purpose: The `every()` method is used to check if all elements in the array satisfy a given condition. It returns `true` only if every element passes the condition; otherwise, it returns `false`.

  - Usage: Like `some()`, the `every()` method takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function is executed for each element in the array until it returns `false` for any element, at which point the `every()` method stops iterating and returns `false`. If all elements satisfy the condition, it returns `true`.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

   const allEvenNumbers = numbers.every((num) => num % 2 === 0);
   console.log(allEvenNumbers); // Output: true (all elements are even)
   ```

These methods are particularly useful when you need to perform validation or check specific properties of the array elements. They provide a concise and expressive way to determine if any or all elements meet a certain condition, reducing the need for manual loops and making the code more readable.

In summary:
- `Array.prototype.some()` returns `true` if at least one element passes the condition.
- `Array.prototype.every()` returns `true` if all elements pass the condition.

Both methods are valuable tools for array processing and filtering, and they are frequently used in various programming tasks to make decisions based on the contents of an array.
