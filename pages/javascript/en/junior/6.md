### What are the differences between the `for...in` and `for...of` loops in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, the `for...in` and `for...of` loops are used to iterate over elements in different ways. Here are the main differences between them:

1. Target of iteration:
  - The `for...in` loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, including properties inherited from its prototype chain. It is primarily used for iterating over object properties.
  - The `for...of` loop iterates over iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, sets, maps, and other iterable objects. It is primarily used for iterating over values in collections.

2. Syntax:
  - `for...in` loop syntax:
    ```javascript
    for (variable in object) {
      // Code to be executed
    }
    ```
  - `for...of` loop syntax:
    ```javascript
    for (variable of iterable) {
      // Code to be executed
    }
    ```

3. Iteration order:
  - `for...in` loop iterates over the keys of an object in an arbitrary order. The order is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in which the properties were defined.
  - `for...of` loop iterates over the values of an iterable object in the order they appear. The order is determined by the iterable itself, and it is typically the insertion order for arrays and string indices.

4. Use cases:
  - `for...in` loop is commonly used for iterating over object properties when you need to access both enumerable properties and properties inherited from the prototype chain.
  - `for...of` loop is commonly used for iterating over values in iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, maps, and sets, where you are interested in the values rather than the keys or properties.

It's worth noting that `for...of` loops cannot be used with regular objects directly since regular objects are not iterable by default. However, you can use techniques like `Object.keys()` or `Object.entries()` to iterate over object properties using a `for...of` loop indirectly.

Overall, the choice between `for...in` and `for...of` depends on the type of data structure you're working with and whether you want to iterate over properties or values.
