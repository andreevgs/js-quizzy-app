### Describe the purpose and usage of the `Array.prototype.map()`, `Array.prototype.filter()`, and `Array.prototype.reduce()` methods in JavaScript.

The `Array.prototype.map()`, `Array.prototype.filter()`, and `Array.prototype.reduce()` are three powerful array methods in JavaScript that provide different ways to manipulate and transform arrays.

1. `Array.prototype.map()`:
  - Purpose: The `map()` method is used to create a new array by applying a provided callback function to each element in the original array. It returns a new array with the results of the callback function applied to each element in the same order.

  - Usage: The method takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function is executed once for each element in the array, and the returned value from the callback becomes an element in the new array.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

   const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
   console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
   ```

2. `Array.prototype.filter()`:
  - Purpose: The `filter()` method is used to create a new array containing only the elements that pass a specified test (provided as a callback function).

  - Usage: The method takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function is executed for each element in the array, and elements for which the callback function returns `true` are included in the new array.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

   const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
   console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
   ```

3. `Array.prototype.reduce()`:
  - Purpose: The `reduce()` method is used to "reduce" an array to a single value based on a provided callback function. It iterates through the array, applying the callback function to each element and accumulating the results.

  - Usage: The method takes a callback function as an argument, but it also takes an initial value (referred to as the "accumulator") as an optional second argument. The accumulator stores the intermediate result and is updated after each iteration.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

   const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, num) => accumulator + num, 0);
   console.log(sum); // Output: 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)
   ```

In summary:
- `Array.prototype.map()` creates a new array by applying a callback function to each element.
- `Array.prototype.filter()` creates a new array with elements that pass a specified test.
- `Array.prototype.reduce()` "reduces" an array to a single value through iteration and accumulation.

These methods are essential tools for working with arrays in JavaScript and are widely used for data transformation, filtering, and summarization tasks. They enable concise and expressive array manipulations and are powerful allies in functional programming paradigms.
