### How do generators differ from regular functions?

Generators in JavaScript differ from regular functions in several key ways, mainly due to their ability to pause and resume their execution. Here are the primary differences between generators and regular functions:

1. Pausing and Resuming Execution:
  - Generators can be paused during their execution using the `yield` keyword. This allows them to produce a sequence of values one at a time, and then pause execution until the next value is requested.
  - Regular functions execute from start to finish in one go, and they cannot be paused or resumed during their execution.

2. Iterability:
  - Generators automatically implement the iterator protocol, making them iterable using `for...of` loops or the spread operator (`...`).
  - Regular functions do not have this built-in iterability, and they must be explicitly called to execute their code.

3. Multiple Yields:
  - Generators can yield multiple values over time, effectively producing an iterable sequence of values. Each time a value is yielded, the generator's state is saved, allowing it to be resumed from the same point later.
  - Regular functions can only return a single value and do not have the ability to pause and resume execution.

4. Controlled Execution:
  - Generators allow controlled execution through the use of the `next()` method, which can be used to step through the generator's code one `yield` statement at a time.
  - Regular functions do not have this controlled execution behavior, and they run to completion each time they are called.

Example comparing Generator and Regular Function:

```javascript
// Generator Function
function* numberGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const generator = numberGenerator();
console.log(generator.next()); // Output: { value: 1, done: false }

// Regular Function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add(3, 4);
console.log(result); // Output: 7
```

In this example, `numberGenerator` is a generator function that yields three values, and it can be iterated one value at a time using `next()`. In contrast, the `add` regular function takes two arguments and returns the sum immediately upon execution, without the ability to pause or yield multiple values.

Generators are especially useful in scenarios where you need to handle asynchronous operations, implement custom iterators, or manage complex control flows. They provide a unique way of handling state and controlling execution in a more flexible and readable manner compared to regular functions.
