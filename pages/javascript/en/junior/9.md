### Explain the concept of function hoisting in JavaScript and how it affects the order of execution.

Function hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior that allows function declarations to be moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that you can invoke a function before it is actually declared in the code. However, it's important to note that only the function declarations themselves are hoisted, not the function expressions or function assignments.

The concept of function hoisting affects the order of execution in the following ways:

1. Function declarations are fully hoisted:
  - When a function is declared using the function declaration syntax, both the function name and the function body are hoisted to the top of their scope.
  - This means you can invoke the function before its actual declaration in the code.
  - For example:
    ```javascript
    myFunction(); // Outputs: "Hello!"

    function myFunction() {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
    ```

2. Order of execution:
  - Function declarations are processed during the compilation phase before the code is executed. Therefore, they are available throughout the entire scope in which they are declared, including before their actual declaration.
  - This allows you to invoke a function anywhere within the scope, regardless of its position in the code.
  - For example:
    ```javascript
    console.log(x); // Outputs: "Hello!"
    var x = "Hello!";

    myFunction(); // Outputs: "Hello!"

    function myFunction() {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
    ```

3. Function expressions and arrow functions:
  - Function expressions, which are assigned to variables, are not hoisted in the same way as function declarations.
  - Only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function assignment itself. As a result, invoking a function expression before its assignment will result in an error.
  - For example:
    ```javascript
    myFunction(); // Error: myFunction is not a function

    var myFunction = function () {
      console.log("Hello!");
    };
    ```

It's important to be aware of function hoisting in JavaScript to avoid potential bugs and ensure code clarity. To write clean and maintainable code, it is recommended to declare functions before using them to avoid reliance on hoisting.
