### What is the purpose of the `Function.prototype.bind`, `Function.prototype.call`, and `Function.prototype.apply` methods in JavaScript?

The `Function.prototype.bind`, `Function.prototype.call`, and `Function.prototype.apply` are methods in JavaScript that allow you to control the context (the value of `this`) and pass arguments to a function during its execution. Each of these methods serves a specific purpose:

1. `Function.prototype.bind`:
  - The `bind` method creates a new function with a specified `this` value and any initial arguments provided.
  - It does not immediately execute the function but returns a new function with the bound `this` value.
  - This method is commonly used when you want to create a function with a fixed context (value of `this`) and potentially some preset arguments.

Example:
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function (message) {
    console.log(`${this.name} says: ${message}`);
  },
};

const boundGreet = person.greet.bind(person);
boundGreet('Hello'); // Output: John says: Hello
```

2. `Function.prototype.call`:
  - The `call` method allows you to call a function with a specified `this` value and arguments provided individually.
  - It immediately executes the function with the given context and arguments.

Example:
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function (message) {
    console.log(`${this.name} says: ${message}`);
  },
};

person.greet.call({ name: 'Jane' }, 'Hello'); // Output: Jane says: Hello
```

3. `Function.prototype.apply`:
  - The `apply` method is similar to `call`, but it allows you to pass arguments to the function as an array-like object instead of individual arguments.
  - Like `call`, it immediately executes the function with the specified `this` value and arguments.

Example:
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function (message) {
    console.log(`${this.name} says: ${message}`);
  },
};

person.greet.apply({ name: 'Jane' }, ['Hello']); // Output: Jane says: Hello
```

The primary purpose of these methods is to provide flexibility in function invocation by allowing you to control the context (`this` value) and arguments passed to the function. This can be especially useful when working with functions that are part of objects or when you need to reuse functions in different contexts.
