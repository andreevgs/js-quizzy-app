### How does the `Array.prototype.forEach()` method work in JavaScript? Provide an example of its usage.

The `Array.prototype.forEach()` method in JavaScript is used to iterate over each element in an array and execute a provided callback function for each element. It does not return a new array; instead, it simply applies the provided function to each element in the array.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
array.forEach(callback(currentValue [, index [, array]]) {
  // Function body
});
```

- `callback`: A function to be executed for each element in the array. It takes three arguments: `currentValue` (the current element being processed), `index` (optional, the index of the current element being processed), and `array` (optional, the array being traversed).

**Usage:**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Example 1: Logging each element to the console
numbers.forEach((num) => {
  console.log(num);
});

// Example 2: Doubling each element in the array in-place
numbers.forEach((num, index, array) => {
  array[index] = num * 2;
});

console.log(numbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Explanation:**

In the first example, `forEach()` iterates over each element in the `numbers` array and logs each element to the console.

In the second example, `forEach()` iterates over the `numbers` array, and for each element, it doubles the value of the element in-place by updating the value in the original array. This demonstrates that `forEach()` directly modifies the array without creating a new one.

**Note:**
- The `forEach()` method is not chainable, meaning it does not return anything (i.e., it returns `undefined`). If you need to perform further operations on the array, consider using other array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, or `reduce()`, which do return new arrays or values.

- The callback function used in `forEach()` can have any name (e.g., `item`, `element`, `el`, etc.). The names `currentValue`, `index`, and `array` are just commonly used conventions, but you can choose any meaningful names that describe the data you are working with.

- `forEach()` executes the callback function for each element in the array sequentially and in order, starting from the first element (index 0) and proceeding to the last element (index `array.length - 1`).

The `forEach()` method is particularly useful when you need to perform an action for each element in the array without creating a new array or storing the results.
