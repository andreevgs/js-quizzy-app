### What are the differences between the `splice()` and `slice()` methods in JavaScript?

The `splice()` and `slice()` methods in JavaScript are both used to manipulate arrays, but they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors.

**1. `splice()` method:**
- Purpose: The `splice()` method is used to add, remove, or replace elements in an array, modifying the original array.

- Usage: The method takes three main arguments: `start` (the index at which to start changing the array), `deleteCount` (the number of elements to remove from the array), and `items` (optional, elements to add to the array at the `start` index).

  ```javascript
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  // Remove elements starting from index 2
  numbers.splice(2); // Modifies the original array, removes [3, 4, 5]
  console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2]

  // Remove 1 element at index 1 and replace with 'x' and 'y'
  numbers.splice(1, 1, 'x', 'y'); // Modifies the original array
  console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 'x', 'y']
  ```

**2. `slice()` method:**
- Purpose: The `slice()` method is used to create a new shallow copy of a portion of an array, without modifying the original array.

- Usage: The method takes two optional arguments: `start` (the index at which to start the copy) and `end` (the index before which to end the copy). If `end` is not specified, it copies until the end of the array.

  ```javascript
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  // Create a new array copy from index 1 to 3 (exclusive)
  const slicedArray = numbers.slice(1, 3); // Does not modify the original array
  console.log(slicedArray); // Output: [2, 3]

  // Create a new array copy starting from index 2
  const newArray = numbers.slice(2); // Does not modify the original array
  console.log(newArray); // Output: [3, 4, 5]
  ```

**Differences:**
1. The main difference between `splice()` and `slice()` is that `splice()` modifies the original array, while `slice()` creates a new array copy.

2. The `splice()` method is versatile and can add, remove, or replace elements in the array based on the arguments provided, while `slice()` is primarily used for copying a portion of an array.

3. `splice()` returns the removed elements (if any), while `slice()` returns the new copied array.

4. `splice()` requires the `deleteCount` argument to specify the number of elements to remove, while `slice()` uses the `start` and `end` arguments to determine the range for copying.

In summary, use `splice()` when you want to modify the original array by adding, removing, or replacing elements, and use `slice()` when you need to create a new array copy without modifying the original array.
