### Explain the concept of IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) in JavaScript and its use cases.

An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that is executed immediately after it is defined. It is a self-invoking function that encapsulates its code within its own scope, preventing variable and function name collisions with the global scope. The syntax for an IIFE involves wrapping the function expression inside parentheses and invoking it with an additional pair of parentheses.

Here are the key points to understand about IIFEs and their use cases:

1. Encapsulation:
  - An IIFE creates a new scope for its code, allowing variables and functions defined within the IIFE to be private and not accessible from the outside.
  - This helps prevent naming conflicts and avoids polluting the global scope.

2. Self-Execution:
  - The function is immediately executed upon its definition, without the need for a separate function call.
  - The invocation is achieved by using an additional pair of parentheses () after the function expression.

3. Data Privacy:
  - By enclosing code within an IIFE, variables and functions can have private and local scope, not accessible from the outside.
  - This enables the creation of modules, libraries, or components with private data and exposed public interfaces.

4. Use Cases:
  - Avoiding Global Scope Pollution: IIFEs are commonly used to wrap code and prevent global scope pollution by keeping variables and functions within the IIFE's private scope.
  - Module Pattern: IIFEs are frequently used to implement the module pattern, allowing the creation of modules with private and public methods.
  - Data Privacy: IIFEs can be used to protect sensitive data by encapsulating it within a private scope.

Example of an IIFE:

```javascript
(function() {
  var message = "Hello, world!";
  console.log(message);
})();
```

In this example, the function is wrapped in parentheses to indicate that it is a function expression, and an additional pair of parentheses at the end immediately invokes the function. The `message` variable is defined within the IIFE's scope and is not accessible from the outside.

The IIFE executes immediately, printing "Hello, world!" to the console.

IIFEs are useful for creating isolated scopes, avoiding global scope pollution, and providing data privacy. They are commonly used in modular JavaScript code and are an effective way to organize and protect code within its own scope.
