### What are closures in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, closures are an important concept that allows functions to retain access to variables from the outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. A closure is formed when a function is defined within another function and has access to the outer function's scope, including its variables, parameters, and inner functions.

Here are key points to understand about closures:

1. Function Scope and Lifetime:
  - In JavaScript, each function creates its own scope, which includes variables, parameters, and nested functions.
  - When a function is executed, its scope is created, and any variables or functions defined within it are accessible.
  - Normally, when a function completes execution, its scope is destroyed, and the variables are no longer accessible.

2. Persistent Access to Outer Scope:
  - Closures allow inner functions to maintain access to the variables and scope of their outer functions, even after the outer function has finished executing.
  - This means that variables from the outer function's scope can still be accessed and used by the inner function.

3. Use Cases:
  - Closures are commonly used for encapsulation and data privacy, allowing you to create private variables and functions within an outer function.
  - They enable the creation of factory functions and function factories, where an outer function returns an inner function with some preconfigured behavior.

4. Example:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  var outerVariable = "Hello";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

var closure = outerFunction();
closure(); // Outputs: "Hello"
```

In the example, the `outerFunction` creates a closure by returning the `innerFunction`. The `innerFunction` maintains access to the `outerVariable` of its outer scope, even after `outerFunction` has completed execution. When `closure` is invoked, it still has access to `outerVariable` and outputs its value.

Closures are a powerful feature in JavaScript that enables advanced techniques and patterns. They allow for maintaining state, creating private variables, and implementing functional programming concepts like currying and partial application. Understanding closures is essential for writing more flexible and modular code in JavaScript.
