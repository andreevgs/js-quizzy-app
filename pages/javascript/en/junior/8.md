### Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript and how it affects variable and function declarations.

Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior that allows variable and function declarations to be moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that you can use variables and invoke functions before they are actually declared in the code. However, it's important to note that only the declarations are hoisted, not the assignments or initializations.

Hoisting affects variable and function declarations differently:

1. Variable declarations:
  - When a variable is declared using `var` (or `let` and `const`, in block scope), the declaration is hoisted to the top of its scope, but the assignment or initialization remains in place.
  - This means you can access and use the variable before it is declared, but its value will be `undefined` until the assignment is reached.
  - For example:
    ```javascript
    console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined
    var x = 5;
    ```

2. Function declarations:
  - Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning both the function name and the function body are hoisted to the top of their scope.
  - This allows you to invoke a function before its actual declaration in the code.
  - For example:
    ```javascript
    myFunction(); // Outputs: "Hello!"
    
    function myFunction() {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
    ```

3. Hoisting and function expressions:
  - Function expressions, which are assigned to variables, are not hoisted in the same way as function declarations.
  - Only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function assignment itself.
  - For example:
    ```javascript
    myFunction(); // Error: myFunction is not a function
    
    var myFunction = function() {
      console.log("Hello!");
    };
    ```

It's important to be aware of hoisting to avoid potential bugs and ensure code clarity. To write clean and maintainable code, it is recommended to declare variables and functions before using them to avoid reliance on hoisting. Additionally, using `let` and `const` instead of `var` provides block scope and helps avoid hoisting-related issues.
