### What are the differences between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, `let`, `const`, and `var` are used to declare variables, but they have some differences in terms of scope, hoisting, and reassignment. Here are the main differences:

1. Scope:
  - `let` and `const` have block scope, which means they are only accessible within the nearest enclosing block (a pair of curly braces `{}`).
  - `var` has function scope, which means it is accessible within the nearest enclosing function, regardless of block boundaries.

2. Hoisting:
  - Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means that you can access a variable before it is declared, although its value will be `undefined` until the assignment is reached in the code.
  - Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ). This means that if you try to access them before their declaration, you will get a `ReferenceError`.

3. Reassignment:
  - Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned a new value.
  - Variables declared with `const` are block-scoped constants and cannot be reassigned after they are assigned a value. However, they are not immutable, so if the assigned value is an object, its properties can still be modified.
  - Variables declared with `var` can also be reassigned, similar to `let`.

4. Global scope:
  - Variables declared with `let` or `const` outside of any block or function have global scope, but they are not added as properties of the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).
  - Variables declared with `var` outside of any block or function have global scope and are added as properties of the global object.

It is generally recommended to use `let` and `const` instead of `var` because they provide block scoping and help avoid common issues caused by hoisting. The choice between `let` and `const` depends on whether you need to reassign the variable or if it should remain constant.
